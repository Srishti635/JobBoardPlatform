# JobBoardPlatform

*JobBoardPlatform* is a frontend web application created to demonstrate practical Software Configuration Management (SCM) skills using Git and GitHub. The main focus is on version control techniques such as branching, commits, pull requests, and merge conflict resolution.

## Project Objective

This project aims to apply SCM practices rather than focusing on frontend features. Key areas demonstrated include:
- Feature branching
- Commit message conventions
- Conflict creation and resolution
- Pull request management
- Version control collaboration simulation

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- Git & GitHub 
- Git Bash (CLI)
## New Job Cards Added

Two new job cards have been added to the job portal:

1. *Microsoft Cloud Engineer*
   - Role focused on deploying and maintaining cloud infrastructure using Microsoft Azure.

2. *Data Scientist*
   - Responsible for analyzing large datasets to gain insights and support business decisions.

These cards are styled consistently and include "Apply Now" buttons.



##  SCM Features Demonstrated

Created branches like frontend-improvements,feature/footer-enhancement,hover-animation-in-button,feature/global-css,feature-bg-light and feature-bg-dark. 
Used proper commit messages like style(body): set background to dark mode(#1a1a1a). 
Created and resolved background color conflict in style.css. 
Created and merged pull requests from feature branches to main. 
Manually resolved merge conflicts between light and dark theme branches. 
All work and changes tracked under the GitHub username Srishti635.
